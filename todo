add exception handling
- add it to the inputs you give in the console
- make two exceptions, not correct type (if you type a string when you need an int for example), and not existing (when the game name doesn't exist for example)
- try to add them everywhere relevant

make admin logic work (make all games available in library at all times)
- whenever you check your library, if there are any games in the magazin, move them over
- also be sure there is no check of ownership when you try to launch a game
